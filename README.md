# Movie_Recommender_System
Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning and NLP!

This project covers the methods and approaches used by the industries to aid them in proposing the things we love to enhance their viewership. Recommendation engines are a widespread area of curiosity on how the content that we love is supplied to us. The primary goal of the project is to recommend movies to the user. To accomplish this, we've used tools like Sklearn, NLTK (natural language tool kit), and pandas' functionality. Additionally, we've integrated the code with a small streamlit application using the web framework Streamlit. This lets you access an actual website toÂ get recommendations for your favorite movies.
